### Introduction to Groups

**AIM(s):** <br>
How can we leverage groups to manage the complexity of our programs?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.2</ins>Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.<br>
<ins>TYS61XT.3</ins>Code using appropriate programming logic<br>
<ins>TYS61XT.4</ins> Code using appropriate syntax.<br> 


**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can construct images using groups.
- [ ] I can modify image properties by modifying group properties (e.g. centerX, centerY, left, top, right, bottom, width, height, rotateAngle, fill, opacity, and visible)

|**DO NOW**|
|---|
|1.  Start a new file in your Python IDLE and save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit5_Lab1_Intro_to_Groups.py`<br><br>2.  Sketch a simple image in your notes containing at least 3 shapes.|

**AGENDA:**
1. Image Quick Share
2. Code Along
    * Construct an image using a group.
    * Modify image properties using group properties.  For example, by clicking / releasing the mouse...
      * Change the position of an image.
      * Move an image (left / right / up / down).
      * Rotate an image.
      * Change the color of an image.
      * Change the opacity of an image.
      * Make an image appear / disappear.
  * Incorporate conditionals.
  * Incorporate buttons.
3. Summary/Close (Think-Pair-Share):
  * In the simplest terms possible, what is a group?
  * Give some examples of group properties we can modify and explain how each will affect each shape in the group.
  * How can we leverage groups to manage the complexity of our programs?
