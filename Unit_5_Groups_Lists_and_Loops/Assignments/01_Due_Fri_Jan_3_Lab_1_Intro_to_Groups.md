# Unit 5, Assignment 1: Lab 1 - Intro to Groups
Due: Friday, January 3th 2025

Create a new file titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit5_Lab1_Intro_to_Groups.py` and copy/paste the following starter code:

```python
# Import the CMU Graphics package:
from cmu_graphics import *


# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

**Use the open space between `from cmu_graphics import *` and `# Run program:` to complete the rest of this lab**

1.  Create a simple image composed of at least three different shapes and assign it to a group.
2.  Use `onMousePress()` to modify one property of your image (e.g. centerX, centerY, etc.) when the mouse is clicked.
3.  Use `onMouseRelease()` to restore your image to its original form when the mouse is released.
4.  Modify `onMousePress()` so that a different property changes depending on where the mouse is clicked.
5.  Modify `onMousePress()` at 3 more times so that a **total of five** different properties change depending on where the mouse is clicked.
