# Unit 0, Project 2: Intellectual Property PSA Task
Due: Wednesday, October 2nd 2024

### In this project you will apply what you have learned about intellectual property to design and present a public service announcement (PSA) to educate the public about the legal and ethical creation and use of intellectual property.

## Requirements:
**Your PSA must address all of the following:**

* What is intellectual property?
* In what ways can one share their own intellectual property?
* In what ways can one protect their own intellectual property?
* What are plagiarism and piracy? (Include specific examples)?
* What are some lesser known examples of plagiarism and piracy that one might accidentally engage in if they didn't know any better?
* What steps can one take to avoid engaging in plagiarism and piracy?
* Describe each of the following (including the advantages and disadvantages of each):
    * Open source software.
    * Open access materials.
    * Creative Commons licenses.


## Format:

To present your PSA, you may use any format (Trifold, Canva, Slide Presentation, Video, Song, Paper, etc.).  However, whatever format you use, you must capture and upload a digital version.  For example, if you create a trifold, you should scan and submit your trifold.  If you create a song, you should submit a digital recording of your song. Etc.
