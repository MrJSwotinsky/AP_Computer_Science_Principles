**AGENDA:**
1. Finish your first draft of your project.
2. Begin to put finishing touches on your project, making progress towards a final draft. 
    - Consider: Did you use all the elements on the checklist?
    - Is each line of code or chunk of code explained by a comment?
    - When you run your project, do all of your elements appear as expected?<br><br>
If you're having trouble coming up with the coordinates, refer to the grid below, or paste the following code into your IDLE to draw gridlines under your project: <br>

```
# Import the CMU Graphics Package:
from cmu_graphics import *

# Paste this code above your project to draw the grid underneath your emoji
for i in range(16):  # 16 rows
    for j in range(16):  # 16 columns
        # Calculate the top-left corner of each cell
        x = j * 25
        y = i * 25
        # Draw the rectangle for each cell
        Rect(x, y, 25, 25, fill=None, border='grey', borderWidth=1)


##YOUR PROJECT CODE GOES HERE

# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

4. Peer feedback: Pair up, and using the handout provided, provide your peer with feedback on their progress.

**HOMEWORK:**
1. Put the final touches on your project, so it can be ready to show in class on Monday. Make at least 8 commits. For one of your commits, implement the feedback you got from your peer at the end of class.
2. In your commit message, include <b>who</b> gave you the feedback and <b>what</b> the feedback was.<br>

|Old Code|Description and Details|
|---|---|
|`Line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`|`Line` is defined by the coordinates of its start and end points <br><br> `lineWidth` determines how thick the line is (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)<br><br> `dashes` can be set to True to draw a dashed line. <br><br> `arrowStart` and `arrowEnd` can be set to True to draw an arrow head on either end of a line.|
|`Polygon(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, …)`|Polygons are drawn by providing a list of coordinate pairs, between which lines will be drawn to form a shape. You need a minimum of 3 coordinate pairs to draw a Polygon. |
|`Label(text, centerX, centerY)`|`text` refers to the text you want to display in the label. <br><br>  `size` changes the size of the text to the given number (the default is 12). <br><br>  `font` changes the font of the text; can be any of the following: 'arial', 'monospace', 'cursive', 'caveat', 'cinzel', 'montserrat', 'grenze', 'sacramento', 'orbitron', or 'symbols'.<br><br>  `bold` or `italic` can either be set to True or False. <br><br> Other familiar properties that can be used to customize Labels are `fill`, `border`, `borderWidth` and `rotateAngle` <br><br> For example, the following code produces the following label: <br> `Label('AP CSP', 200,200, size=100, font='monospace',fill=gradient('lightSkyBlue','navy', start='top'), border='blue', bold=True)` <br> <img src="https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Label.png" width="300px">|
|`Oval(centerX, centerY, width, height)`|Unlike rectangles, the first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the oval. <br><br> The `rotateAngle` property can be used to rotate the oval, or any shape (MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 360). For example : `Oval(50,50,30,30, rotateAngle=45`)|
|`Circle(centerX, centerY, radius)`|The first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the circle. <br><br>`radius` defines the length of half the circle (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)|
|`Star(centerX, centerY, radius, points, roundness=none)`| The first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the star. <br><br>`radius` determines how large the star is (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)<br><br> `points` determines how many points are in the star (MUST BE GREATER THAN 2) <br><br> `roundness` changes how round the star is (MUST BE BETWEEN0 to 100)|
|`gradient(color1, color2, color3, ..., start='center')`|`Gradient` can be used in place of a color for the `fill` parameter. <br><br>For example, in the following code: `Rect(50,50,100,100,fill='blue')`,`'blue'` can be replaced by `gradient('yellow','blue',start='top')` as such: <br><br>`Rect(50,50,100,100,fill=gradient('yellow','blue',start='top'))`<br><br>Gradients need at least 2 colors and can have up to as many colors as you want it to.<br><br>The parameter `start` can be used to customize the gradient.<br><br>The argument passed to `start` can be used to define where the first color begins and then the gradient will proceed linearly or radially across the shape. `start` is set to 'center' by default and can be set to the following values: <br><br> <img src = "https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Gradient_Start_Values.png">|
|`Rect(left, top, width, height, fill, border, borderWidth)`|The parameters `fill`, `border`, and `borderWidth` can be used to customize rectangles (and other shapes).<br><br>Arguments passed to `fill`, `border`, and `borderWidth` are passed using the **keyword passing technique** meaning they are passed using parameter names.<br><br>The argument passed to `fill` sets the color of the rectangle.<br><br>The argument passed to `border` sets the color of the rectangle's border.<br><br>The argument passed to `borderWidth` sets the width of the rectangle's border.<br><br>Built in colors may be described using their names such as `'midnightBlue'` or `'hotPink'`.  CMU Graphics has a over 100 built-in colors.  **Note:** When using color names, the color names must be surrounded by quotes.<br><br>Other colors may be described using their RGB Triplets such as `rgb(75,15,120)`, a shade of very dark purple, similar, but not identical to, CMU Graphics' `'indigo'` or `rgb(255,180,5)` a shade of bright orange, similar, but not identical to, CMU Graphics' `'orange'`. **Note:** When using RGB triplets, quotes are not required. <br><br>**Example**:<br>`Rect(50, 100, 40, 80, fill = 'navy', border = rgb(185,245,250), borderWidth = 5)` generates a navy rectangle with a light blue border that is 5 pixels wide, as shown below.<br><br><img src = "https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Rectangle_Image.png" width=50%>
