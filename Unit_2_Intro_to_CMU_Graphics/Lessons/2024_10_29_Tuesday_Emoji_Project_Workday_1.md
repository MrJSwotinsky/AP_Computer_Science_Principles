### Emoji Project Workday #1

**AIM(s):** <br>
How can I use sub-goal labels to organize my code and start coding a first draft of my emoji project? <br><br>

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.3</ins> Code using appropriate programming logic.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.4</ins> Code using appropriate syntax.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.5</ins> Communicate effectively as a Computer Scientist.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.6</ins> Engage in the design thinking process to iteratively develop your work.<br> 

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I have written comments to outline my code
- [ ] I have started coding a first draft of my emoji project
- [ ] I have received and recorded one piece of feedback from a peer.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>DO NOW:</b><br>
      1. Make or open your project code file <br>
      2. Use comments (as you would bullet points) to start listing out all the different elements you need to code for your project.<br>
      For example, If I were coding a cat, my code file would look like this: <br><br>
      #Head<br>
      #Eyes<br>
      #Ears<br>
      #Whiskers<br>
      ...etc.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**
1. Do Now Share Out
2. Finish writing an outline of your project using comments
    - Consider: Are my elements listed in the proper order? (Remember, lines of code are run in order. If you are coding different layers, the bottom layers need to be coded before the top layers)
3. Start a first draft of your project
    - Under each comment, start writing the code for that element.
4. Peer feedback: Pair up, and using the handout provided, provide your peer with feedback on their progress.

**HOMEWORK:**
1. Work on your project, making at least 3 commits. For one of your commits, implement the feedback you got from your peer at the end of class.
2. In your commit message, include <b>who</b> gave you the feedback and <b>what</b> the feedback was.<br>

|Old Code|Description and Details|
|---|---|
|`Line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`|`Line` is defined by the coordinates of its start and end points <br><br> `lineWidth` determines how thick the line is (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)<br><br> `dashes` can be set to True to draw a dashed line. <br><br> `arrowStart` and `arrowEnd` can be set to True to draw an arrow head on either end of a line.|
|`Polygon(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, â€¦)`|Polygons are drawn by providing a list of coordinate pairs, between which lines will be drawn to form a shape. You need a minimum of 3 coordinate pairs to draw a Polygon. |
|`Label(text, centerX, centerY)`|`text` refers to the text you want to display in the label. <br><br>  `size` changes the size of the text to the given number (the default is 12). <br><br>  `font` changes the font of the text; can be any of the following: 'arial', 'monospace', 'cursive', 'caveat', 'cinzel', 'montserrat', 'grenze', 'sacramento', 'orbitron', or 'symbols'.<br><br>  `bold` or `italic` can either be set to True or False. <br><br> Other familiar properties that can be used to customize Labels are `fill`, `border`, `borderWidth` and `rotateAngle` <br><br> For example, the following code produces the following label: <br> `Label('AP CSP', 200,200, size=100, font='monospace',fill=gradient('lightSkyBlue','navy', start='top'), border='blue', bold=True)` <br> <img src="https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Label.png" width="300px">|
|`Oval(centerX, centerY, width, height)`|Unlike rectangles, the first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the oval. <br><br> The `rotateAngle` property can be used to rotate the oval, or any shape (MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 360). For example : `Oval(50,50,30,30, rotateAngle=45`)|
|`Circle(centerX, centerY, radius)`|The first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the circle. <br><br>`radius` defines the length of half the circle (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)|
|`Star(centerX, centerY, radius, points, roundness=none)`| The first two parameters give us the center coordinates for the star. <br><br>`radius` determines how large the star is (MUST BE GREATER THAN 0)<br><br> `points` determines how many points are in the star (MUST BE GREATER THAN 2) <br><br> `roundness` changes how round the star is (MUST BE BETWEEN0 to 100)|
|`gradient(color1, color2, color3, ..., start='center')`|`Gradient` can be used in place of a color for the `fill` parameter. <br><br>For example, in the following code: `Rect(50,50,100,100,fill='blue')`,`'blue'` can be replaced by `gradient('yellow','blue',start='top')` as such: <br><br>`Rect(50,50,100,100,fill=gradient('yellow','blue',start='top'))`<br><br>Gradients need at least 2 colors and can have up to as many colors as you want it to.<br><br>The parameter `start` can be used to customize the gradient.<br><br>The argument passed to `start` can be used to define where the first color begins and then the gradient will proceed linearly or radially across the shape. `start` is set to 'center' by default and can be set to the following values: <br><br> <img src = "https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Gradient_Start_Values.png">|
|`Rect(left, top, width, height, fill, border, borderWidth)`|The parameters `fill`, `border`, and `borderWidth` can be used to customize rectangles (and other shapes).<br><br>Arguments passed to `fill`, `border`, and `borderWidth` are passed using the **keyword passing technique** meaning they are passed using parameter names.<br><br>The argument passed to `fill` sets the color of the rectangle.<br><br>The argument passed to `border` sets the color of the rectangle's border.<br><br>The argument passed to `borderWidth` sets the width of the rectangle's border.<br><br>Built in colors may be described using their names such as `'midnightBlue'` or `'hotPink'`.  CMU Graphics has a over 100 built-in colors.  **Note:** When using color names, the color names must be surrounded by quotes.<br><br>Other colors may be described using their RGB Triplets such as `rgb(75,15,120)`, a shade of very dark purple, similar, but not identical to, CMU Graphics' `'indigo'` or `rgb(255,180,5)` a shade of bright orange, similar, but not identical to, CMU Graphics' `'orange'`. **Note:** When using RGB triplets, quotes are not required. <br><br>**Example**:<br>`Rect(50, 100, 40, 80, fill = 'navy', border = rgb(185,245,250), borderWidth = 5)` generates a navy rectangle with a light blue border that is 5 pixels wide, as shown below.<br><br><img src = "https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Resources/Rectangle_Image.png" width=50%>
