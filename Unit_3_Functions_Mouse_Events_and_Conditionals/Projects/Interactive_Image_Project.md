# Interactive Image Project
Due: Friday, December 13th 2024

**TASK:** Use CMU Graphics to code a personalized interactive image that represents you!

## To be submitted:
Upload the following items to a new folder in your GitHub AP CSP Portfolio titled, `Emoji_Project`:<br><br>
* An initial description or sketch of your emoji.
* The code required to produce your emoji (including appropriate comments and a robust, well-documented version history).
* An image of your emoji (including a robust, well-documented version history).
* A written reflection

## Requirements:

* Your emoji must represent you.  It is up to you to determine how your emoji represents you.  Be Creative!

* Your emoji must include **all** of the following shapes:
    * Rectangle
    * Circle
    * Oval
    * Star
    * Line
    * Polygon
    * Label

* Your emoji must contain **all** of the following fills:
    * A color represented by name.
    * A color represented by RGB triplet.
    * A gradient

* Your emoji must demonstrate ability to pass arguments to **all** of the following parameters:
    * border (applies to any shape)
    * borderWidth (applies to any shape)
    * rotateAngle (applies to any shape)
    * radius (applies to circles and stars)
    * points (applies to stars)
    * roundness (applies to stars)
    * lineWidth (applies to lines)
    * font (applies to labels)
    * size (applies to labels)
    * bold or italic (applies to labels)
    * font (applies to labels)
 
* Your written reflection must address **all** of the following prompts:
    * Describe this project and its purpose.  In other words, what were you required to do? Why did you choose to create the specific emoji you created, and in what ways does it represent you?
    * In what ways did this project contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major at IEC? In other words, what specific skills did you learn? What challenges did you encounter? In what ways did you grow as a Computer Science major?
    * How did you iteratively develop your emoji over time? In other words, What was your initial idea, and how did it change as you worked through this project? What challenges did you run into and how did you troubleshoot them? What feedback did you receive, and how did you use it to modify your work?  This is also a good opportunity to provide a **brief** narrative that walks through the version history of your work.
    * Looking back, what might you have done differently? In other words, what would you change about either your emoji itself or your process?
    * If you were to further develop this project, what would your next steps be? In other words, if given more time to work on this project, what would you do next? Is there something you do not yet know how to do, that you would like to learn in order to further develop this project?
