Due: Thursday, November 7 2024

Create a new python file in your Physical Device > AP CSP Portfolio folder titled, LastNameFirstInitial_U3_Lab1_Function_Basics.py, and complete the following lab:

1.  Copy/paste the following starter code into your file.

```python
# Import the CMU Graphics package:
from cmu_graphics import *


# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

**Use the open space between `from cmu_graphics import *` and `# Run program:` to complete the rest of this lab**

2. Define a function that takes at least two parameters, and draws some image. The function body should have at least 3 lines.

   ```python
   def functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
      # Function body goes here. Remember to indent.
   ```
4. Write a function call. Remember to unindent, so that the function call lines up with the function definition, rather than the function body.

 ```python
   def functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
      # Function body goes here. Remember to indent.

   # Function call goes here. Remember to unindent
   ```
6. Use comments code comments to respond to the following prompts.  Remember, code comments start with the `#` symbol and end at the end of the line.

* In your own words describe the difference between the function definition and function call.
    * What happens when you comment out the function call?
    * Why?
