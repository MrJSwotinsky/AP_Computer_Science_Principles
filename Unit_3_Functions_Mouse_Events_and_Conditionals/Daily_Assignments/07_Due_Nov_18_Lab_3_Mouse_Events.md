Due: Monday, November 18 2024

Create a new python file in your Physical Device > AP CSP Portfolio folder titled, LastNameFirstInitial_U3_Lab2_Parameters.py, and complete the following lab:

1.  Copy/paste the following starter code into your file.

```python
# Import the CMU Graphics package:
from cmu_graphics import *



# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

**Use the open space between `from cmu_graphics import *` and `# Run program:` to complete the rest of this lab**

2. Using `onMousePress()` and `onMouseRelease()` , write a program that draws some image while the mouse button is pressed, and changes when the mouse button is released. *For example: A day time scene that turns into a night time scene, or an apple that turns into an orange* 
  
3. Use comments code comments to respond to the following prompts.  Remember, code comments start with the `#` symbol and end at the end of the line.

* In your own words describe what a mouse event is.
* How is a mouse event different from a function?
* What happens if you name the mouse event parameters something other than x and y? (Try it and find out--remember that if you change the parameter names you should also change them in the function body)
* Do the mouse events work if you change the function names? For example, changing `onMousePress()` to `onMouseClick()`? (Try it and find out)
